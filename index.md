# Git and GitHub

Want to learn how Git and GitHub work? Want to understand what people mean when they talk about repositories, pull requests, GitHub pages? Git and GitHub are wonderful tools for version management, and to share your work.

In this workshop you will begin to understand and use Git/GitHub. You will not be an expert by the end of the clas, you might not even feel very comfortable using Git. This is okay. We want to make a start but, as with any skill, using Git takes practice.
